        <h4 class="text-primary"><strong>THE DOMINICAN MUSIC</strong></h4>
        <p class="text-justify"> The music of the Dominican Republic refers to the popular, traditional or folkloric
          musical manifestations of the Dominican Republic oriented to the description of the
          Dominicans, their character, culture and customs. It has its own well-defined
          features, as well as a clear external influence, first of all, of Spanish and
          African music, in rhythmic, tonal and harmonic aspects.
        </p>
        <img src="..//images/d-inst.jpg" alt="THE DOMINICAN MUSIC" class="img-fluid">
        <p class="text-justify"> During the colonial period, the inhabitants of Santo Domingo listened mostly to music
          imported from
          Europe, but there was also a
          significant exchange with the other Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. The Latin
          American adaptation of Spanish contradanza was very popular throughout the region,
          where it later developed in ways such as dance (still existing in Puerto Rico),
          danzón (in Cuba), and other related genres. The calenda of African origin is also
          found in many of the islands and currently survives in various forms found in
          Martinique, Trinidad and Carriacou (Granada).

        <h4 class="text-primary"><strong>HISTORY</strong></h4>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The history of Dominican music naturally begins with the independence of
          Spain in 1821 and Haiti (which had taken over the Spanish part of the island
          in 1822) in 1844. The merengue appears for the first time only a decade more
          late.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/perico.jpg" alt="THE DOMINICAN MUSIC" class="img-fluid">

        <p class="text-justify">Although the origins of this dance are very
          debated, it seems to have evolved from the mixture of African and
          Spaniards in force at that time in all the Spanish colonies of the Caribbean. In a
          At the beginning, it was played on the tambora, the güira (scraper), and any instrument of
          chord that appeared, from guitar to three or four. Thus,
          many Dominicans consider music to symbolize their tripartite heritage, a
          combination of Africans (represented by the tambora), Europeans (the
          guitar or accordion) and the Taíno Indians (the güira, although its origins are
          debatable).

        <h4 class="text-primary"><strong>THE DOMINICAN CLASSICAL MUSIC</strong></h4>
        <p class="text-justify"> Classical music is not a strong genre in Dominican society. However, since the
          creation of the first entities oriented to this current in the early 90s, today its
          evolution and development is palpable, although it has a long way to go to attract
          the general public. Darwin Aquino, director of the National Youth Symphony, and
          teacher Catana Pérez de Cuello, former director of the Eduardo Brito National
          Theater, agree that the classical is not a music that is permeated in our tradition.
          As the musicologist also explained, this is because the people do not know and do
          not care, in addition to having the concept that it is "dead music."
        </p>
        <img src="/images/MERENGUE.jpg" alt="THE DOMINICAN MUSIC" class="img-fluid">
        <p class="text-justify"> "Before, at Easter, and when he died
          an ‘important’ person, what was placed was classical music and although that
          habit has passed, belief subsists. There is also a lack of knowledge because
          people have no way to approach, and people usually show indifference
          towards what they don't know, ”said Catana Pérez in an interview with elCaribe. Understands
          that their little penetration in the town is due to a matter of education, because the
          audiences have nowhere to learn about this genre and therefore are not interested.
          "As long as there is no art education in school, which allows children
          grow up knowing about classical music, how are they going to know it if their parents
          they are equally unaware. The classical remains in an intellectual elite, because it is the
          population that knows it, ”said Catana.
